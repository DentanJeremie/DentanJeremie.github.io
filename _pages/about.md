Hi, I'm J√©r√©mie üëã

I'm a PhD candidate in ML security and privacy at √âcole Polytechnique Paris, supervised by [Prof. Sonia Vanier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonia-vanier-31657061/) and [Prof. Davide Buscaldi](https://sites.google.com/site/davidebuscaldi/). I also collaborate with Cr√©dit Agricole as part of the "Responsible and Trustworthy AI" partnership with √âcole Polytechnique.

My research focuses on security and privacy issues in machine learning. I'm particularly interested in the robustness of Large Language Models against privacy attacks. I have developed some new adversarial attacks to reconstruct training data from multimodal models. I am now working on auditing tools to better understand and predict memorization, for practitioners to develop robust models.

I grew up in the south of France, near Aix-en-Provence. I followed the French engineering curriculum, with two years of "classe pr√©paratoire" at [Sainte Genevi√®ve](https://www.bginette.com) in Versailles, before attending the engineering curriculum at [√âcole Polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program), where I graduated in 2022. I also graduated from [ENS Paris-Saclay "MVA" Master](https://www.master-mva.com) in 2023, specializing in "Mathematics, Vision, leArning". I started my PhD at √âcole Polytechnique Paris in 2023.
